# hello-world
whatever
Otterbein UMC is situated in Bethlehem Township in Stark County.
We border Fairless, Sandy Valley, Perry and Canton Local school districts.
We are a family oriented church that has lots to offer, but most importantly
a personal relationship with Jesus Christ! Stop by and see us!
